Puck is a toy image editor. It generates a tiny 8x8 image, which you can navigate by keyboard (`h j k l` for orthogonal movement, `y u b n` for diagonal) and alter by incrementing or decrementing palette indices. Your cursor is the white circle. You can't save the image or modify the color palette, but those features will come later.

Here's a screenshot of Puck in action:
